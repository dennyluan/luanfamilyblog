> It's about the smells and the sounds!

We decided to move to China. We've temporarily left behind beautiful Oahu, our home for the past 6 years, and where you, Ollie, were born 8 months ago. And now we're embarking on another wreckless, overly ambitious adventure, for ~~two~~ three people with eyes bigger than their stomachs.

Well, your Mama Cindy hasn't quite decided to fully move to China yet, but your baba Denny has had his mind made up for nearly two years now. Probably longer. But it's finally happening! First, we'll do a short stop in Taipei, Taiwan for you baby Ollie to meet your great grandma 阿祖 ("Ah-Zao!"). And then, after the first week of September, we plan to land in Shanghai, China where we'll stay until November in your other great grandmother's old apartment. She passed away last year before you got to meet her, but it's the same apartment your uncle Alan and I spent our summers in as kids. It's currently empty, we're hoping to make it work. After that, we might visit a few other cities, depending on how you feel!

It'll be something like a trial run. Your Mama is not quite convinced on what life in China would be like, so we settled on this compromise of a 3 month test period. Also, cause that's the limit that our current visa allows. But, I am convinced that once we are there, it'll become obvious why I've been so excited to do this for so long.

I've talked up this move to anyone who would listen for the past 2 years. A lot of people immediately respond with a bunch of questions - Why? Do you have family there? Are you going for work? Is it expensive? What about the pollution? Isn't the economy terrible? What about all the gommunism? The questions from my incredulous parents have been especially persistent, as they can't comprehend why we would want to do something so radical. But I've been more persistent.

The real reason for why we're doing this is a bunch of reasons combined, so I decided to write them down, and hopefully use this post to explain. They are in order of increasing importance:


## 1. Levelling up from 哑巴 ya-ba

As a Chinese kid born in America in June 1989, the day Tiananmen protests started, who shamefully spent his life not speaking Chinese despite years of Saturday morning Chinese school and even a college summer course for ABC bananas like me, *being* Chinese is something I've always struggled with. Kind of stuck in between two vast worlds, with neither foot that solidly planted. On the one hand, I've travelled countless times over the past 36 years and witnessed dramatic changes in China during the 1990s - walking dirt roads to my grandmother's house in Hefei which has now been replaced with shiny highrises. I've sat around family room dinner tables with relatives eavesdropping on conversations about the Cultural Revolution. Week long road trips from Xian to the Three Gorges Dam before the valleys were flooded, floating down Li Jiang on bamboo rafts, climbing Huashan, the Great Wall, Jiuzhaigou, Qingdao, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hong Kong...

I've probably seen more of an older, no longer existing China than most Chinese people. Despite that, I have never felt like I've felt the weight of being Chinese beyond just what my parents gave me as experiences. I've always been hungry to dig beyond the surface - to participate in rich Chinese internet culture, read and learn 文言文 for myself, and try to make an impact in a Chinese speaking world that was walled off from the rest of the world but that I felt like I had a peephole into. So finally, for the past year at the age of 36, I started re-re-re-learning Chinese, this time dilligently. There's only so much improvement I can get with reading, watching videos, participating in internet discussions, doing all the things I always felt too scared or ill-equipped to do. But the final step is the most important one, which is to just live in China and be fully immersed in it.

With this, we desperately hope that you can grow up in a richly multi-lingual environment, and that your access to any world will be unencumbered. Chinese, English, and Spanish at the very least! It will be hard, but hopefully this will be a big step towards that goal.

## 2. Better quality of life

China is safer, cheaper, more efficient, family friendly, and there's better food. However, very selfishly, there are no surfable waves in Shanghai. We're about to find out just how much access to warm water matters to us. Because despite the very expensive cost of living in Hawaii, being able to watch you grow up in the water with us is still a very special opportunity. Maybe we'll do a trip to Sanya, China's version of Hawaii.

We've found a great community for you in Honolulu, and for that we are very grateful. That is a big looming factor in the opportunity cost equation running in my head. If we stayed and settled down in Oahu forever, we could be incredibly happy.

But, there would still be *something* missing, a hole that couldn't be filled. Living in a happy bubble with so much tumultuous change happening right outside of it, although insulated and safe from it, is not quite the toolkit that I want to equip you with before you step into the tall grass wilderness by yourself. Eventually those changes will hit Hawaii, just as it will the rest of the world.

Maybe leaving China is a trade-off, of comfort on an island away from the storm in your early years, and instead being able to navigate the world confidently later in your life.


## 3. Fear of missing out

The future of the world will be in China's collective hands. There is too much happening there to ignore. I've known this would be eventually true since I was a kid, and it felt like I was always watching and waiting for it to finally happen, where China's present would catch up to it's future potential. Well, it's happening, and I think it's happening right now.

In college, I always dreamt that I would eventually try to strike out for Shanghai and spend some time there working. Instead, I met your Mama and we started a company together. For a long time, I only vaguely watched the growth from afar, but that changed dramatically over the past 5 years as it became something that I could no longer ignore.

China just became the single greatest producer of science and technology, with 8 of the top 10 research producing institutions in the world now based in China. I believe this trend is permanent. America will still be a very important place for innovation and a certain kind of progress, but it's not even about any single particular niche, industry, or measure of progress. I could talk about electric cars, high speed trains, clean energy, AI, video games, movies, etc. But it's not about any of that - it's about the spirit.

When your Mama and I first entered Silicon Valley in 2012 to start our first company, we were only 21 years old. There was something electric in the air that infected us, that made it so that two clueless and naive, but deadly ambitious kids were filled with the feeling that we couldn't fail. We musn't fail. Failure wasn't an option, it was a necessity to iterate and keep improving until we succeeded. Partly because the mission that we were working on was that important to us, and that everyone around us felt that same electric buzz. It was Silicon Valley's true source of power, one that made it feel like everyone was collectively moving towards a brighter and better future for humanity. Older and more mature now, I know now how much of it was our naivete, but it was still undeniably a real phenomena.

I haven't felt that feeling about the tech industry in the U.S. for many years now. Crypto, AI, and whatever next bubble comes are all uninspiring and feel like dead end attempts to squeeze the last bit of life out of the real builders who haven't already left. But I feel this positive buzz again whenever I'm in China. So, we're headed there to go look for it, and to find the source.


## 4. Our labor in society

This one is hard, and may be something you won't come to understand for a while. It's something I've thought incredibly hard about, and has kept me up many nights. The best way to put it is that we're making a conscious decision about how and where we spend our time.

In our lives, we only have our time. Both your Mama and I made a commitment that the life we want to live is one that we build with our own hands, with our own labor. Not through sitting on or hoarding capital, or exploiting others for personal gain. So, because we only have our labor, where the benefits of our labor ends up doing matters a lot.

America is currently broken, and in my opinion, it is unsalvageable. The ultimate goal of America might be personal freedom and liberty, but it might also be imperialism and colonialism. We've thrashed against this system for 15 years now, and I'm tired. I can no longer condone my energy and labor going towards a system of violence.

I definitely do not think China is currently perfect, or that it will remain a better alternative forever. But I know enough Chinese history to see where it is going, and as long as China remains a high-trust society, I think it will be a safer bet for us as a family.

So as long as I am working towards a goal or building something, I want the impact of it to be towards a system that I ultimately believe in. And right now, I currently do not believe that doing so in America is a net positive.

## 5. Smells & sounds

The last reason is the most important and tangible, and it's that I want to give you the smells and sounds of China and Taiwan.

I want to embed them in your brain, so that you can recall them later in your life. The humidity, the cicadas buzzing, the waft of sinky tofu, the busses and moped squeeks, the crowded subways, the tasty food, the hot sun, the sitting around and playing with family members whose names and faces you'll eventually forget. If everything above that I've said ends up not coming true, at least this one will always be true.

Anyways, all of this is certainly risky. I have no idea how it's going to turn out. Maybe we'll get there and decide it's too much, or it's not for us, or we get homesick. It will be an immense challenge in so many ways, basically starting from scratch again. But it's one that we're looking forward to. Thanks for coming along with us baby boy.
